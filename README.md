# Snack Game

Welcome to the Snack Game project! This is a simple console-based game written in C++.

## How it Works

The Snack Game is a classic snake game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen and eats food. As the snake eats food, it grows longer, and the goal is to avoid collisions with the snake's own body and the screen borders.

## Prerequisites

Before running the game, make sure you have the following installed:

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
